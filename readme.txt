# Jeremy Loves Live Reload Bulma WordPress Theme

## Live Reload and Bulma Integration

This WordPress theme is configured with live reload functionality using BrowserSync, allowing you to see changes to your Sass files and CSS in real-time. It also includes the Bulma CSS framework for easy and responsive styling.

## Getting Started

To run this theme locally and leverage the live reload feature, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Set up a local development environment such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to run your WordPress site.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this theme to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the theme directory in your WordPress installation: `wp-content/themes/your-theme-folder`.

3. Open your command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal) and navigate to the theme folder.

4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Once the installation is complete, you can start the theme and enable live reload using the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. BrowserSync will launch a new browser window/tab with your WordPress site. Any changes you make to your Sass files (e.g., `sass/style.scss`) or the compiled CSS file (e.g., `style.css`) will trigger an automatic browser refresh.

### Modifying Files

If you need to make changes to the Sass files or any other files in the theme, follow these steps:

1. Modify the respective files according to your requirements.

2. Save the file.

3. BrowserSync will detect the changes and automatically refresh the browser to reflect the updated styles.
